### Hi there 👋
I'm Mário Rodrigues*. Before you dive into my profile, here are a few things I want you to know about me!

💁‍♂️‍ I am a 18-year-old boy! <br />
📖  I am a student at Universidade do Minho in Braga, PT. I am currently in my first year of Computer Science. <br />
💻  I started programming games when I was 12 years old. Between the ages of 13 and 14 I tried to learn as much as I could about Web Development. At 16, I started competitive programming (using C++) and since there i never stopped. </br>
